Problem Statement:

The problem statement is focused on building a workable Order-Book Management System. 
The term Order-Book refers to an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific financial instrument like stocks.

System will have 2 kind of Users – Admin and Customers.
Customers can place new order for stocks purchasing  when market is open and Admin can execute the orders when market is closed.
The market open/close action will be handled by Admin. Once market is closed, no new orders can be placed by Customers
When the market is closed , Admin has to ‘execute’ the orders . Detailed logic is provided in next slides.
The system focus on only Buying the financial instrument .
